Session hash

sessions are encrypted

placed under the user's create method
after the user logs in... we need to update the page to show they are actually logged in

in application update with unless logged in


in layour... make sure theres a before action that sets the instance to something

Application Controller:
site wide before action... takes place on every page...

 the way to remember we're passed in

 when the person comes back... we use the session to keep the persons information
 put in application controller
 create helper method in login controller


       destroy  method in controller...
       should be able to redirect
  in the controller make sure you put skip before action :verify_authenticity_token

  #to logout
  def destroy
  session[:user_id] = nil
  redirect to the index
  end
  put into application controller as a form tag
  make sure the routes are uodated

  delete "/logout" to logbdestry

  if @logged_in && @vote.user_id == @logged_in_user_id
  @vote.destroy
  so if we're logged in and you have permission then delete
  otherwise... dontt

  else flash[:error]= ["This isnt your account"]
  redirect_to new_login_path
  return
  authenticate when you go to create update and delete actions
log in...

index for votes
if logged in do votes
else redirect to login path
